## Kazam — Screen recorder with area selection

Works only on Xorg, not Wayland!

Kazam supports recording:
* full screen
* a window
* a selected area
* multiple monitors
* audio recording
* webcam overlay
* OCR (in newer versions)
* countdown before recording (useful for area selection)


## Alternative tools, TODO, check:
1. Kooha (Wayland‑native, area recording supported)
2. GNOME Screen Recorder (built‑in Wayland recorder with rectangular selection)
3. OBS Studio (supports Wayland area capture via PipeWire)
